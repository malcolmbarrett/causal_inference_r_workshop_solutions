For this set of exercises, we'll use propensity scores for continuous exposures.

In the touringplans data set, we have information about the posted waiting times for rides. We also have a limited amount of data on the observed, actual times. The question that we will consider is this: Do posted wait times (`avg_spostmin`) for the Seven Dwarves Mine Train at 8 am affect actual wait times (`avg_sactmin`) at 9 am? Here’s our DAG:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggdag)

coord_dag <- list(
  x = c(Season = -1, close = -1, weather = -2, extra = 0, x = 1, y = 2),
  y = c(Season = -1, close = 1, weather = 0.25, extra = 0, x = 0, y = 0)
)

labels <- c(
  extra = "Extra Magic Morning",
  x = "Average posted wait ",
  y = "Average actual wait",
  Season = "Ticket Season",
  weather = "Historic high temperature",
  close = "Time park closed"
)

wait_time_dag <- dagify(
  y ~ x + close + Season + weather + extra,
  x ~ weather + close + Season + extra,
  coords = coord_dag,
  labels = labels
)

wait_time_dag %>%
  ggdag(use_labels = "label", text = FALSE) +
  theme_void() +
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(-2.25, 2.25), 
    breaks = c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2), 
    labels = c("\n(one year ago)", "\n(6 months ago)", "\n(3 months ago)", "8am-9am\n(Today)", "9am-10am\n(Today)")
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text())
```

First, let’s wrangle our data to address our question: do posted wait times at 8 affect actual weight times at 9? We’ll join the baseline data (all covariates and posted wait time at 8) with the outcome (average actual time). We also have a lot of missingness for `avg_sactmin`, so we’ll drop unobserved values for now.

You don't need to update any code here, so just run this.

```{r}
eight <- seven_dwarfs_train_2018 %>% 
  filter(hour == 8) %>% 
  select(-avg_sactmin)

nine <- seven_dwarfs_train_2018 %>% 
  filter(hour == 9) %>% 
  select(date, avg_sactmin)

wait_times <- eight %>% 
  left_join(nine, by = "date") %>% 
  drop_na(avg_sactmin)
```

# Your Turn 1

First, let’s calculate the propensity score model, which will be the denominator in our stabilized weights (more to come on that soon). We’ll fit a model using `lm()` for `avg_spostmin` with our covariates, then use the fitted predictions of `avg_spostmin` (`.fitted`, `.sigma`) to calculate the density using `dnorm()`.

1. Fit a model using `lm()` with `avg_spostmin` as the outcome and the confounders identified in the DAG.
2. Use `augment()` to add model predictions to the data frame
3. In `dnorm()`, use `.fitted` as the mean and the mean of `.sigma` as the SD to calculate the propensity score for the denominator.

```{r}
denominator_model <- lm(
  __________, 
  data = wait_times
)

denominators <- denominator_model %>% 
  ______(data = wait_times) %>% 
  mutate(
    denominator = dnorm(
      avg_spostmin, 
      mean = ______, 
      sd = mean(______, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(date, denominator)
```

# Your Turn 2

As with the example in the slides, we have a lot of extreme values for our weights

```{r}
denominators %>% 
  mutate(wts = 1 / denominator) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(wts)) +
  geom_density(col = "#E69F00", fill = "#E69F0095") + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 20) + 
  xlab("Weights")
```

Let’s now fit the marginal density to use for stabilized weights:

1. Fit an intercept-only model of posted weight times to use as the numerator model
2. Calculate the numerator weights using `dnorm()` as above.
3. Finally, calculate the stabilized weights, `swts`, using the `numerator` and `denominator` weights

```{r}
numerator_model <- lm(
  ___ ~ ___, 
  data = wait_times
)

numerators <- numerator_model %>% 
  augment(data = wait_times) %>% 
  mutate(
    numerator = dnorm(
      avg_spostmin, 
      ___, 
      mean(___, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(date, numerator)

wait_times_wts <- wait_times %>% 
  left_join(numerators, by = "date") %>% 
  left_join(denominators, by = "date") %>% 
  mutate(swts = ___)
```

Take a look at the weights now that we've stabilized them:

```{r}
ggplot(wait_times_wts, aes(swts)) +
  geom_density(col = "#E69F00", fill = "#E69F0095") + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 20) + 
  xlab("Stabilized Weights")
```

Note that their mean is now about 1! That means the psuedo-population created by the weights is the same size as the observed population (the number of days we have wait time data, in this case).

```{r}
round(mean(wait_times_wts$swts), digits = 2)
```


# Your Turn 3

Now, let's fit the outcome model!

1. Estimate the relationship between posted wait times and actual wait times using the stabilized weights we just created. 

```{r}
lm(___ ~ ___, weights = ___, data = wait_times_wts) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  filter(term == "avg_spostmin") %>% 
  mutate(estimate = estimate * 10)
```

## Stretch goal: Boostrapped intervals

Bootstrap confidence intervals for our estimate.

There's nothing new here. Just remember, you need to bootstrap the entire modeling process!

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
library(rsample)

fit_model <- function(split, ...) { 
  .df <- analysis(split) 
  
  # fill in the rest!
}

model_estimate <- bootstraps(wait_times, 1000, apparent = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(results = map(splits, ______))

# using bias-corrected confidence intervals
boot_estimate <- int_bca(_______, results, .fn = fit_model)

boot_estimate
```

# Take aways

* We can calculate propensity scores for continuous exposures. Here, we use `dnorm(true_value, predicted_value, mean(estimated_sigma, rm.na = TRUE))` to use the normal density to transform predictions to a propensity-like scale. We can also use other approaches like quantile binning of the exposure, calculating probability-based propensity scores using categorical regression models. 
* Continuous exposures are prone to mispecification and usually need to be stabilized. A simple stabilization is to invert the propensity score by stabilization weights using an intercept-only model such as `lm(exposure ~ 1)`
* Stabilization is useful for any type of exposure where the weights are unbounded. Weights like the ATO, making them less susceptible to extreme weights.
* Using propensity scores for continuous exposures in outcome models is identical to using them with binary exposures.

# Your Turn 1

For the parametric G-formula, we'll use a single model to fit a causal model of `qsmk` on `wt82_71` where we  include all covariates, much as we normally fit regression models. However, instead of interpreting the coefficients, we'll calculate the estimate by predicting on cloned data sets.

First, let's fit the model. 

1.Use `lm()`. We'll also create an interaction term with `smokeintensity`. 
2. Save the model as `standardized_model`

```{r}
standardized_model <- lm(
  wt82_71 ~ qsmk + I(qsmk * smokeintensity) + smokeintensity + 
    I(smokeintensity^2) + sex + race + age + I(age^2) + education + smokeyrs + 
    I(smokeyrs^2) + exercise + active + wt71 + I(wt71^2), 
  data = nhefs_complete
)
```


# Your Turn 2

Now that we've fit a model, we need to clone our data set. To do this, we'll simply mutate it so that in one set, all participants have `qsmk` set to 0 and in another, all participants have `qsmk` set to 1.

1. Create the cloned data sets, called `kept_smoking` and `quit_smoking`.
2. For both data sets, use `standardized_model` and `augment()` to get the predicted values. Use the `newdata` argument in `augment()` with the relevant cloned data set. Then, select only the fitted value. Rename `.fitted` to either `kept_smoking` or `quit_smoking` (use the pattern `select(new_name = old_name)`).
3. Save the predicted data sets as`predicted_kept_smoking` and `predicted_quit_smoking`.

```{r}
kept_smoking <- nhefs_complete %>% 
  mutate(qsmk = 0)

quit_smoking <- nhefs_complete %>% 
  mutate(qsmk = 1)

predicted_kept_smoking <- standardized_model %>% 
  augment(newdata = kept_smoking) %>%
  select(kept_smoking = .fitted)

predicted_quit_smoking <- standardized_model %>% 
  augment(newdata = quit_smoking) %>%
  select(quit_smoking = .fitted)
```

# Your Turn 3

Finally, we'll get the mean differences between the values. 

1. Bind `predicted_kept_smoking` and  `predicted_quit_smoking` using `bind_cols()`
2. Summarize the predicted values to create three new variables: `mean_quit_smoking`, `mean_kept_smoking`, and `difference`. The first two should be the means of `quit_smoking` and `kept_smoking`. `difference` should be `mean_quit_smoking` minus `mean_kept_smoking`.

```{r}
bind_cols(predicted_kept_smoking, predicted_quit_smoking) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_quit_smoking = mean(kept_smoking),
    mean_kept_smoking = mean(quit_smoking),
    difference = mean_quit_smoking - mean_kept_smoking
  )
```

That's it! `difference` is our effect estimate. To get confidence intervals, however, we would need to use the bootstrap method. See the link below for a full example.

## Stretch goal: Boostrapped intervals

Like propensity-based models, we need to do a little more work to get correct standard errors and confidence intervals. In this stretch goal, use rsample to bootstrap the estimates we got from the G-computation model. 

Remember, you need to bootstrap the entire modeling process, including the regression model, cloning the data sets, and calculating the effects.

```{r}
library(rsample)

fit_gcomp <- function(split, ...) { 
  .df <- analysis(split) 
  
  # fit outcome model
  standardized_model <- lm(
    wt82_71 ~ qsmk + I(qsmk * smokeintensity) + smokeintensity + 
      I(smokeintensity^2) + sex + race + age + I(age^2) + education + smokeyrs + 
      I(smokeyrs^2) + exercise + active + wt71 + I(wt71^2), 
    data = .df
  )
  
  # clone datasets
  kept_smoking <- .df %>% 
    mutate(qsmk = 0)
  
  quit_smoking <- .df %>% 
    mutate(qsmk = 1)
  
  # predict change in weight for each cloned dataset
  predicted_kept_smoking <- standardized_model %>% 
    augment(newdata = kept_smoking) %>%
    select(kept_smoking = .fitted)
  
  predicted_quit_smoking <- standardized_model %>% 
    augment(newdata = quit_smoking) %>%
    select(quit_smoking = .fitted)
  
  # calculate ATE
  bind_cols(predicted_kept_smoking, predicted_quit_smoking) %>% 
    summarize(
      mean_quit_smoking = mean(quit_smoking),
      mean_kept_smoking = mean(kept_smoking),
      difference = mean_quit_smoking - mean_kept_smoking
    ) %>% 
    # rsample expects a `term` and `estimate` column
    pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "term", values_to = "estimate")
}

gcomp_results <- bootstraps(nhefs_complete, 1000, apparent = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(results = map(splits, fit_gcomp))

# using bias-corrected confidence intervals
boot_estimate <- int_bca(gcomp_results, results, .fn = fit_gcomp)

boot_estimate
```

# Your Turn 4

1. Take a look at how many participants were lost to follow up in `nhefs`, called `censored` in this data set. You don't need to change anything in this code.

```{r}
nhefs_censored <- nhefs %>%
  drop_na(
    qsmk, sex, race, age, school, smokeintensity, smokeyrs, exercise,
    active, wt71
  )

nhefs_censored %>% 
  count(censored = as.factor(censored)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(censored, n)) + 
  geom_col()
```

2. Create a logistic regression model that predicts whether or not someone is censored. 

```{r}
cens_model <- glm(
  censored ~ qsmk + sex + race + age + I(age^2) + education +
    smokeintensity + I(smokeintensity^2) +
    smokeyrs + I(smokeyrs^2) + exercise + active +
    wt71 + I(wt71^2),
  data = nhefs_censored, 
  family = binomial()
)
```

# Your Turn 5

1. Use the logistic model you just fit to create inverse probability of censoring weights
2. Calculate the weights using `.fitted`
3. Join `cens` to `nhefs_censored` so that you have the weights in your dataset
4. Fit a linear regression model of `wt82_71` weighted by `cens_wts`. We'll use this model as the basis for our G-computation

```{r}
cens <- cens_model %>%
  augment(type.predict = "response", data = nhefs_censored) %>%
  mutate(cens_wts = 1 / ifelse(censored == 0, 1 - .fitted, 1)) %>%
  select(id, cens_wts)

#  join all the weights data from above
nhefs_censored_wts <- nhefs_censored %>%
  left_join(cens, by = "id")

cens_model <- lm(
  wt82_71 ~ qsmk + I(qsmk * smokeintensity) + smokeintensity +
    I(smokeintensity^2) + sex + race + age + I(age^2) + education + smokeyrs +
    I(smokeyrs^2) + exercise + active + wt71 + I(wt71^2),
  data = nhefs_censored_wts,
  weights = cens_wts
)
```

# Your Turn 6

1. Next, we usually need to clone our datasets, but we can use `kept_smoking` and `quit_smoking` that we created in the first section
2. Use the outcome model, `cens_model`, to make predictions for `kept_smoking` and `quit_smoking`
3. Calculate the differences between the mean values of `kept_smoking` and `quit_smoking`

```{r}
predicted_kept_smoking <- cens_model %>%
  augment(newdata = kept_smoking) %>%
  select(kept_smoking = .fitted)

predicted_quit_smoking <- cens_model %>%
  augment(newdata = quit_smoking) %>%
  select(quit_smoking = .fitted)

#  summarize the mean difference
bind_cols(predicted_kept_smoking, predicted_quit_smoking) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_quit_smoking = mean(kept_smoking),
    mean_kept_smoking = mean(quit_smoking),
    difference = mean_quit_smoking - mean_kept_smoking
  )
```

## Stretch goal: Boostrapped intervals

Finish early? Try bootstrapping the G-computation model with censoring weights

Remember, you need to bootstrap the entire modeling process, including fitting both regression models, cloning the data sets, and calculating the effects.

```{r}
fit_gcomp_cens <- function(split, ...) { 
  .df <- analysis(split) 
  
  # fit the censoring model. remember to model using `.df` instead of `nhefs_censored`
  cens_model <- glm(
    censored ~ qsmk + sex + race + age + I(age^2) + education +
      smokeintensity + I(smokeintensity^2) +
      smokeyrs + I(smokeyrs^2) + exercise + active +
      wt71 + I(wt71^2),
    data = .df, 
    family = binomial()
  )
    # calculate the inverse probability of censoring weights. remember to predict `.df` instead of `nhefs_censored`
  cens <- cens_model %>%
    augment(type.predict = "response", data = .df) %>%
    mutate(cens_wts = 1 / ifelse(censored == 0, 1 - .fitted, 1)) %>%
    select(id, cens_wts)
  
  #  join all the weights data from above to .df
  nhefs_censored_wts <- .df %>%
    left_join(cens, by = "id")
  
  # fit outcome model. remember to model using `nhefs_censored_wts` instead of `nhefs_censored` or `.df`
  standardized_model <- lm(
    wt82_71 ~ qsmk + I(qsmk * smokeintensity) + smokeintensity +
      I(smokeintensity^2) + sex + race + age + I(age^2) + education + smokeyrs +
      I(smokeyrs^2) + exercise + active + wt71 + I(wt71^2),
    data = nhefs_censored_wts,
    weights = cens_wts
  )
  
  # clone datasets. remember to clone `.df` instead of `nhefs_censored`
  kept_smoking <- .df %>% 
    mutate(qsmk = 0)
  
  quit_smoking <- .df %>% 
    mutate(qsmk = 1)
  
  # predict change in weight for each cloned dataset
  predicted_kept_smoking <- standardized_model %>% 
    augment(newdata = kept_smoking) %>%
    select(kept_smoking = .fitted)
  
  predicted_quit_smoking <- standardized_model %>% 
    augment(newdata = quit_smoking) %>%
    select(quit_smoking = .fitted)
  
  # calculate ATE
  bind_cols(predicted_kept_smoking, predicted_quit_smoking) %>% 
    summarize(
      mean_quit_smoking = mean(quit_smoking),
      mean_kept_smoking = mean(kept_smoking),
      difference = mean_quit_smoking - mean_kept_smoking
    ) %>% 
    # rsample expects a `term` and `estimate` column
    pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "term", values_to = "estimate")
}

gcomp_results <- bootstraps(nhefs_censored, 1000, apparent = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(results = map(splits, fit_gcomp_cens))

# using bias-corrected confidence intervals
boot_estimate <- int_bca(gcomp_results, results, .fn = fit_gcomp_cens)

boot_estimate
```

# Take aways

* To fit the parametric G-formula, fit a standardized model with all covariates. Then, use cloned data sets with values set to each level of the exposure you want to study. 
* Use the model to predict the values for that level of the exposure and compute the effect estimate you want
* If loss to follow-up is potentially related to your study question, inverse probability of censoring weights can help mitigate the bias.

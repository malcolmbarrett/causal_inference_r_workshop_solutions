We are interested in examining the relationship between whether there were "Extra Magic Hours" in the morning (the **exposure**) and the average wait time for the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train the same day between 9am and 10am (the **outcome**).

## Your turn

Use the `tip_coef()` function to conduct a sensitivity analysis for the estimate from your previous exercises.

```{r}
tip_coef(4.35, smd = 0.6)
```
